Let's implement a complete Firebase chat feature for a React Native project.

1. First, use the official **Firebase MCP** to initialize the Firebase project,
   create both Android and iOS apps, and download the required configuration files
   (`google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist`).

2. Then, use the **rn-firebase-chat MCP** to implement the chat functionality —
   including Firestore setup, and real-time messaging logic...

3. If needed, integrate the chat UI using **rn-base-component MCP** for component rendering.
